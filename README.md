# 100-days-of-code
Coding for 100 days for atleast an hour and trying to get better at coding. <br>
This repo will also contain details about me learning cybersecurity as well.
## Day 1 - 26/01/2021
Refreshing the basics of data structures and complexity from algo expert. Need one more day to complete basics of DS. then will move on to exploring OOP using python.
## Day 2 - 27/01/2021
Concepts of memory allocation, learned a couple of new concept was a good choice learning this concept. DS is taking longer than expected as well as I was pretty busy.
## Day 3 - 28/01/2021
Working on time and space complexity, I belive DS will take this week, I will try to finish it asap then start working on Algorithms.
