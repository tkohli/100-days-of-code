# 100-days-of-code
Coding for 100 days for atleast an hour and trying to get better at coding. <br>
This repo will also contain details about me learning cybersecurity as well.
## Day 1 - 26/01/2021
Refreshing the basics of data structures and complexity from algo expert. Need one more day to complete basics of DS. then will move on to exploring OOP using python.
## Day 2 - 27/01/2021
Concepts of memory allocation, learned a couple of new concept was a good choice learning this concept. DS is taking longer than expected as well as I was pretty busy.
## Day 3 - 28/01/2021
Working on time and space complexity, and Logs I belive DS will take this week, I will try to finish it asap then start working on Algorithms. 
## Day 4 - 29/01/2021
Finally started Data structure core topics, today I finished arrays both static and dynamic , representation of arrays in memory and basic of different operations. 
## Day 5 - 30/01/2021
Today I completed Linked list, hash tables and all of their common operations and will try to start stacks. I also have to make pages for my website. I am officially running late!
## Day 6 - 31/01/2021
Stacks are now completed working on string ,graphs and tree. I am weak in these topic so I will be spending little bit more time understanding them. Tommorow will be last day of this data structure crash course. Then I will start OOP in python.
