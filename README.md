# 100-days-of-code
Coding for 100 days for atleast an hour and trying to get better at coding. <br>
This repo will also contain details about me learning cybersecurity as well.
# Week 0 Because that's how coder's count.
For this week I will just make sure that my concepts are clear and explore stuff. I already have basic knowledge so I recommend you guys spending more time on basics.
I watched videos from algoexpert Data Structures Crash course and then refresh basics of python.<br>Note - I actually never thought that I will be able to complete even a single week of the #100DaysofCode it feels good, many weeks to go.
# Week 1 Important concepts - OOPs in Python.
We should focus more on learning how this code is working and writing clean code following the writing conventions helps in becoming a better programmer. I always felt uncomfortable working whenever I have to use Classes in python, as I was used to classes in Java and c++ this time I focused on learning more concepts and it helped me alot. Next week I will be starting questions on different topics.
# Week 2 Getting our hand's dirty - 
This week I got really busy had some personal work, now I am doing Google IT Automation with Python it has 6 course Attaching link below. It is actually a must try course.
# Week 7 Algorithms here I come, P.S. I am running late
So I was unable to commit weekly for past some time but I did alot of new things I got azure certificate, Google IT automation, made on OCR converter in python and also made an attendence tracker in AWS cloud.<br>
It was a very fun time now I will be focusing on programming and make some more projects using python. 

# Daily updates<br>
## Day 1 - 26/01/2021 Tuesday
Refreshing the basics of data structures and complexity from algo expert. Need one more day to complete basics of DS. then will move on to exploring OOP using python.
## Day 2 - 27/01/2021 Wednesday
Concepts of memory allocation, learned a couple of new concept was a good choice learning this concept. DS is taking longer than expected as well as I was pretty busy.
## Day 3 - 28/01/2021 Thursday
Working on time and space complexity, and Logs I belive DS will take this week, I will try to finish it asap then start working on Algorithms. 
## Day 4 - 29/01/2021 Friday  
Finally started Data structure core topics, today I finished arrays both static and dynamic , representation of arrays in memory and basic of different operations. 
## Day 5 - 30/01/2021 Saturday
Today I completed Linked list, hash tables and all of their common operations and will try to start stacks. I also have to make pages for my website. I am officially running late!
## Day 6 - 31/01/2021 Sunday
Stacks are now completed working on string ,graphs and tree. I am weak in these topic so I will be spending little bit more time understanding them. Tommorow will be last day of this data structure crash course. Then I will start OOP in python.
## Day 7 - 01/02/2021 Monday
I have completed basics of Data structures and today I will do a quick python refresher just covering very basics of python. Leaving OOP part of python will do it tommorow.
## Day 8 - 02/02/2021 Tuesday
Today I started Object Oriented Programming in Python, I have never studied this topic and it is very interesting to learn this concept in python, I also completed Inheritance and overloading.
## Day 9 - 03/02/2021 Wednesday
Almost lost today but somehow managed to work, today I did overriding the built in funtions and knowing how the internal funtions like  __gt__, __len__, __eq__  works. they are pretty much fun to learn.  
## Day 10 - 04/02/2021 Thursday
Still doing Object oriented programming, today I did static and class methods and will work on website development alot of work is left need to finish it asap. I also need to study Azure I have an exam on 7th hope I clear it this time.
## Day 11 - 05/02/2021 Friday
